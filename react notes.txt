use: npm run dev 
to run an react app

use: npm create vite@latest 
to create an react project

✅Day 1:
Vite is a build tool  - that helps to create a project - helps to deploy an project bundle your project


an isolated piece of UI that can independently be handled using react

and component can be used multiple times
component is a single piece of UI

when you create a react project there will be one file present whose name is "index.html",
and this is the only file load inside the browser, then you get a default component whose name is the "App" component

and "App" This will be loaded in the index.html

our job is to create a component and put it in the App component

programmatically component is a JS function that will return an html

package.json is a configuration file

public is a static assests

index.css is a global css file

JSX expression must have one parent element

use curly braces to add the int props to an component
 <Product name="iPhone 16" price={80000}></Product>

only index.html will be loaded in the browser

✅Day 2:
we need to decide which component to serve as a page and which is to be compatible as a component

we can apply the css to the parent component and the child component will automatically inhrit the css

📍Routing:
loading diff comp based on url making it look like pages

we have to use the react-router-dom
which is not downloaded bydefault

this gives you the Four things:
import { BrowserRouter,Routes,Route,Linl } from 'react-router-dom'

      <BrowserRouter>
          
          <Routes>

            <Route  path='/home' element={<Home/>}></Route>
            <Route path='/product' element={<Product/>}></Route>

          

          </Routes>

      </BrowserRouter>


we have to render the routes like this 

we can use link component inside the BrowserRouter

create an following two folder's to organize the directory structure


📍Event handling:

create a function in the component

 <button onClick={printSomething}>Click me</button>

write the printSomething function outside the return and while calling don't use parenthesis(), it will automatically called when the page will be loaded

📍State: (is a react feature)
data of component - when state data changes component refreshes itself

let [name,setName]=useState("Atharva")

this is asynchronous task

a variable cannot be called as a state in the react (react doesn't consider this)

when the state of an particular component changes only that component get's re-rendered

📍special function- Hooks: use to attach the feature of the react


✅Day 3 (List, forms and lifecycle methods):
📍map:
foreach doesn't return anything
map function return's an new element
the map function is just like a foreach loop, but it creates a new array by modifying each element

it's possible to pass an array


📍Lifecycle of react component:
every compo that we create has an lifecycle
